=CFMLAdmin API=

==CFML Engine Implementation Details==

===Adobe ColdFusion===
* CFMLAdmin API does not accept RDS Password to login.

===Open BlueDragon===

===Railo===
* All CFMLAdmin API calls execute against the current web context and not server-wide
* All CFMLAdmin API calls execute only on current server, does not use remoteClients attribute on Railo's cfadmin tag

==Database Implementation Details==

===My SQL===
* setDatasource() databasetype="mysql" on Adobe ColdFusion defaults to MySQL5 driver

===Microsoft SQL Server===
* setDatasource() databasetype="mssql" on Railo and Open BlueDragon defaults to using the jTDS JDBC driver  

===Oracle===
* setDatasource() databasetype="oracle" on Railo and Open BlueDragon uses thin driver and not OCI
* setDatasource() databasetype="oracle" on Adobe ColdFusion Standard Edition does not work, since using DataDirect drivers shipped by Adobe  

===Other JDBC===
* Open BlueDragon requires a validation query when connecting to an other JDBC driver, CFMLAdmin API defaults this to "SELECT 1"
 
==Remote Access to CFMLAdmin API==
* By default .disabled is added to the end of the filename cfmladminremoteapi.cfc so it cannot be invoked, to enable remove .disabled
